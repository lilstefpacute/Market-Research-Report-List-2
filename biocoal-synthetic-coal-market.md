<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocoal (Synthetic Coal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biocoal, also known as synthetic coal, is an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional coal derived from biomass processing. The market for biocoal can be categorized into two main types: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen, resulting in a solid, energy-dense biocoal product. Steam explosion is a process that uses high-pressure steam to rumble and open up biomass fibers, producing a more porous and reactive biocoal. Both methods contribute to the growing demand for clean and sustainable energy solutions.</p></p>
