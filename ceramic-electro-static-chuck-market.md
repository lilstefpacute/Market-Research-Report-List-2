<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Electro Static Chuck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coulomb Type</li><li>Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ceramic Electro Static Chuck (ESC) market is categorized into two main types: Coulomb Type and Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type. Coulomb Type ESCs utilize a static charge to hold objects in place. They rely on the Coulomb force, which occurs between charged particles, to achieve the desired grip. On the other hand, JR Type ESCs employ an additional vacuum-activated mechanism alongside the Coulomb force. This vacuum action enhances the chuck's gripping strength, making it more effective in applications requiring high stiffness and stability.</p></p>
