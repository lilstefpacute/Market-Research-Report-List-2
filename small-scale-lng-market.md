<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Small Scale LNG market consists of two types: Liquefaction Terminal and Regasification Terminal. Liquefaction Terminals are facilities that convert natural gas into liquefied natural gas (LNG) by cooling it to extremely low temperatures, allowing for easier storage and transportation. On the other hand, Regasification Terminals receive LNG and convert it back into its gaseous form by increasing the temperature, enabling it to be distributed through pipelines or used as fuel. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in the Small Scale LNG market, facilitating the movement and utilization of natural gas.</p></p>
