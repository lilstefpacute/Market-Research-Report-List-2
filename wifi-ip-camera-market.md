<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wifi IP Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Camera</li><li>Decentralized IP Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The WiFi IP camera market consists of two main types: centralized IP cameras and decentralized IP cameras. Centralized IP cameras require a central network video recorder (NVR) to store and process the video data, while decentralized IP cameras have built-in storage capability to function independently. Centralized cameras are typically used in larger surveillance systems, offering centralized control and management. On the other hand, decentralized cameras are suitable for smaller systems or areas with limited network access, as they can operate autonomously without relying on a central recording device.</p></p>
