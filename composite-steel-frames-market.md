<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Steel Frames Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steel-concrete Composite</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Composite Steel Frames Market comprises two main types: Steel-concrete Composite and Others. Steel-concrete Composite frames are constructed using a combination of steel and concrete, where the steel beams and columns are encased within a concrete shell to enhance the overall structural performance. This type offers high strength and stiffness, making it suitable for tall buildings and heavy-load applications. On the other hand, the "Others" category represents alternative materials or techniques used to construct composite frames, such as composite trusses or fiber-reinforced polymer composites.</p></p>
