<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D LiDAR Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid State Lidar</li><li>Mechanical/Scanning Lidar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D LiDAR Sensor market consists of two main types: Solid State LiDAR and Mechanical/Scanning LiDAR. Solid State LiDAR systems use a fixed beam to scan their surroundings, capturing the environment without moving parts. This type of LiDAR is more compact, affordable, and offers a wide field of view, making it suitable for various applications. In contrast, Mechanical/Scanning LiDAR employs moving components to rotate or oscillate the scanner, resulting in a narrower field of view. Although more expensive and complex, Mechanical/Scanning LiDAR provides higher accuracy and longer range measurements.</p></p>
