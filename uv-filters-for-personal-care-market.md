<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>UV filters are essential components in personal care products like sunscreens, moisturizers, and cosmetics to protect our skin from harmful UV radiation. Mineral UV filters, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, work by reflecting and scattering UV rays. These filters sit on top of the skin and provide immediate protection. On the other hand, organic UV filters, such as avobenzone and octinoxate, absorb UV radiation and convert it into less harmful heat energy. These filters penetrate the skin and provide longer-lasting protection. Both mineral and organic UV filters play a crucial role in safeguarding our skin from the damaging effects of UV rays.</p></p>
